## Implementing Expectation-Maximisation algorithms for Kmeans and GMM models
1. Kmeans algorithm implementation from scratch on the MNIST, FASHION MNIST and 20NG dataset using gini and purity index for cluster evaluation
2. Gaussian Mixture Models with 2 and 3 mixtures on gaussian2.txt and gaussian3.txt
3. EM algorithm to determine the biased and mixing probability of coins from coin flips
